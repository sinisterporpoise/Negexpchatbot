2021-11-25 19:26:17 [textMessage] [] [Gretchen Beach] That is why I was always questioning KJ and Nat's relationship. Nat smeared KJ in the deposition, why is she on a panel with Nat?

2021-11-25 19:55:38 [textMessage] [] [Rose] Nat made a video claiming Kay planned it

2021-11-25 19:56:31 [textMessage] [] [E.M.P.] i feel like there's a big difference between being 'opinionated' and a hyperbolic pile of crap, just saying , as it seems a lot of the time these people who claim to be opinionated are bad players
2021-11-25 19:56:32 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][An Intrigued Feline] But we know that Nat stirs things up.
2021-11-25 19:56:37 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][An Intrigued Feline] So we cannot take her word at it
2021-11-25 19:57:15 [textMessage] [] [Absynthe12] Nat is totally untrustworthy
2021-11-25 19:57:19 [textMessage] [] [TheAthens619] in the words if Kay: "It's their agenda"
2021-11-25 19:57:28 [textMessage] [] [Stark views] what's funny as they believe her when she says something that suits them
2021-11-25 19:57:53 [textMessage] [] [Unveiling The Masks] Stark views exactly 
2021-11-25 19:57:55 [textMessage] [] [E.M.P.] kinda like when people have the word truth as part of their user name. they are full of crap ]
2021-11-25 19:58:01 [textMessage] [] [Which god of thousands means nothing] It seems we live in a time where the definition of "truth" is ambiguous.
2021-11-25 19:58:11 [textMessage] [] [Claire S. Bear] Everyone cherry picking when to believe "Nat" to fit their narratives .... cant believe any of it, tainted as she admits to lying A LOT ... imho of course
2021-11-25 19:58:41 [textMessage] [] [Jolly Bridge-Burner] agree @Claire S. Bear 
2021-11-25 19:58:48 [textMessage] [] [TheAthens619] just talking about them is considered "harassment"
2021-11-25 19:58:49 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][Cheshire Viq] IMO - Steve isnt even being hostile or mean now
2021-11-25 19:58:56 [textMessage] [] [Stark views] Exactly @claire you have you then ask yourself, Why?
2021-11-25 19:59:03 [textMessage] [] [Lee Veltman] :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: Truth Claire 
2021-11-25 19:59:06 [textMessage] [] [Which god of thousands means nothing] Yep.... "truth" as part of a username means 99% chance bullshit.
2021-11-25 19:59:12 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][Cheshire Viq] Steve is rightly upset and reasonably explaining WHY like an adult
2021-11-25 19:59:25 [textMessage] [] [E.M.P.] ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^6
2021-11-25 19:59:34 [textMessage] [] [TheAthens619] Steve doesn't get mad or angry unless you make him

2021-11-25 20:00:31 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][Mr. Serious] I don't want to live in a world where what's happening to steve is simply tolerated and acceptable... 
2021-11-25 20:00:42 [textMessage] [] [Peta Hine] I can't believe someone would draw a 3 hour "confession" from a known liar. Nat will say whatever to fit where she feels will get attention.
2021-11-25 20:01:12 [textMessage] [] [Absynthe12] KJ joined in waxy's allegations and kay did seem like she agreed
2021-11-25 20:02:05 [textMessage] [] [Claire S. Bear] @Cheshire Viq Exactly .... apparently it is harrassment to *ask people to be damn adults and accept accountability for their own actions ffs ridiculous imho *typos stink btw too
2021-11-25 20:02:07 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][Cheshire Viq] that's something I didnt understand about Irish - she wants her account of her interactions with Nat to be so important but then turns around and says it shows/proves nothing
2021-11-25 20:02:16 [textMessage] [] [Absynthe12] KJ claimed she had a "ton" of evidence against Steve
2021-11-25 20:02:22 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][Cheshire Viq] @Claire S. Bear lol
2021-11-25 20:02:27 [textMessage] [] [Peta Hine] exactly Nat got KJ's attention by suddenly blaming Steve. she went along with it cause KJ gave Nat attention after that
2021-11-25 20:02:28 [textMessage] [] [Stark views] Until the FBI arrest Nat I don't trust anything from Twitter mouths.
2021-11-25 20:02:32 [textMessage] [] [Claire S. Bear] @Cheshire Viq YES! Make that make sense like wth?

2021-11-25 20:10:26 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][Cheshire Viq] @Nat Do you have your guardian with you? You should have your guardian reach out to steve independently

2021-11-25 20:13:27 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][An Intrigued Feline] @Aureii YT That means not talking to Chesh, as she is one of the people slandered against.

2021-11-25 20:14:11 [textMessage] [] [Rose] that "allegedly" was definitely an afterthought & was stated with a rude tone of voice
2021-11-25 20:14:23 [textMessage] [] [Unveiling The Masks] Exactly Rose 
2021-11-25 20:14:50 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][Mr. Serious] lol! i do love to use the word "allegedly" but more tongue in cheek...

2021-11-25 20:15:02 [textMessage] [] [Unveiling The Masks] :prohibited: hey hun! Gtsy 
2021-11-25 20:15:19 [textMessage] [] [E.M.P.] chesh murdered a bunch of bs narratives, it was bloody

2021-11-25 20:18:02 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][Mr. Serious] menace has only accidentally been correct.... and that's extremely rare
2021-11-25 20:18:11 [textMessage] [] [Rose] that's what's so frustrating @Chesh, Kay is choosing not to correct the record. is she so afraid to grant any grace to you, Steve & the others who were accused?
2021-11-25 20:18:27 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][Cheshire Viq] @Mr. Serious and when that happens its still for the wrong reasons
2021-11-25 20:18:47 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][Mr. Serious] @Cheshire Viq yep
2021-11-25 20:19:22 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][Cheshire Viq] @Rose she is selfish - only cares when it benefits her or if things happen to her. 
2021-11-25 20:19:29 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][Mr. Serious] giving you heat is harassment 
2021-11-25 20:19:38 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][Cheshire Viq] @Steve McRae ya just ask Katie lol "its not harassment to call out the lies of a liar"
2021-11-25 20:19:38 [textMessage] [] [Suzanne is Salty "That Crazy Feminist Writer"] Asking her to correct something is not harassment
2021-11-25 20:19:41 [textMessage] [] [Claire S. Bear] @Mr. Serious a broke clock is right twice a day just saying...no credit for the lying arse 
2021-11-25 20:19:50 [textMessage] [] [E.M.P.] sad when a broken clock is right more often than m2s

2021-11-25 20:21:37 [textMessage] [] [Claire S. Bear] Why is defending yourself against misinformation being called "Harrassment" ? Are they allergic to accountability ... are they deflecting? or are they actually the harrassers? @Steve McRae 
2021-11-25 20:21:44 [textMessage] [] [Rose] :waving_hand: @Suzanne :blue_heart:

2021-11-25 20:22:48 [textMessage] [] [GingerLeigh] She offered a suggestion, different from a demand
2021-11-25 20:22:50 [textMessage] [] [Rose] CHESH DEMANDS TO SEE THE MANAGER :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
2021-11-25 20:22:59 [textMessage] [] [kimmo mäki] I heard Chesh offer a suggestion. Kay heard Chesh make a command.
2021-11-25 20:23:09 [textMessage] [] [Aureii YT] I learned this week that there's always people resisting to correct things because they don't see they put out misinformation.

2021-11-25 20:24:07 [textMessage] [] [Moderate Extremist] nothing was demanded ... an annotation to her "update" with 1/4 of the views was politely suggested, she just isn't an honest agent, again, she can take several seats 
2021-11-25 20:24:10 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][Mr. Serious] Yeah... call me out! :drooling_face:

2021-11-25 20:25:38 [textMessage] [] [Rhianna Johnson] Cheshire specifically said it was advice and even followed it up with "you don't have to take my advice". I'm shocked at the outright lies, especially when it's on video

2021-11-25 20:26:44 [textMessage] [] [kimmo mäki] She also said that Steve had 'told her' to remove her video. No evidence of this, either.

2021-11-25 20:33:30 [textMessage] [] [GingerLeigh] Chesh used the words “Suggestion “ and “advice”
2021-11-25 20:33:45 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][Cheshire Viq] and "maybe" and "could"
2021-11-25 20:33:48 [textMessage] [] [Aureii YT] Was Kay who said Steve asked her to remove the video?
2021-11-25 20:33:59 [textMessage] [] [Miss E] Kay should just admit she thought it was you behind it and now she she doesn’t. At least say my bad but don’t deny you thought and said it.
2021-11-25 20:34:02 [textMessage] [] [kimmo mäki] I've asked several sincere questions and Steve's responses have always been honest, forthright and relevant.

2021-11-25 20:36:03 [textMessage] [] [GingerLeigh] Well I follow her and I do t believe what she was implying :woman_tipping_hand:One cannot possibly know what all of their followers believe!
2021-11-25 20:36:49 [textMessage] [] [Miss E] It seemed like she was implying that the trolls were sent by you in the Live. That’s what I thought she meant
2021-11-25 20:37:01 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][Cheshire Viq] Plus when it was edited if it WAS in the algorithm, it would have been pulled OUT
2021-11-25 20:37:27 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][Cheshire Viq] Why does she want people to watch that video??? @Steve McRae 
2021-11-25 20:37:57 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][Cheshire Viq] @Steve McRae WHY does she WANT that video to get MORE views KNOWING that there are HORRIBLE accusations of people that are UNTRUE in it?!?!!?!?!

2021-11-25 20:38:24 [superChat] [NZ$5.00] [AureaUnicornis] She wants to know why the video on which you and several people were falsely accused is not getting more views. That video without any clarification. 
2021-11-25 20:39:23 [textMessage] [] [Shieena Living Waters] I listened to videos in question so i could weigh in. Seems a lot of vagueness and ambiguity from those 2 women. Seems they are uncomfortable admitting any wrongs.

2021-11-25 20:41:15 [textMessage] [] [Claire S. Bear] Why clear up the misinformation when you can make money on the bullshit and keep it going? @Steve McRae 
2021-11-25 20:42:09 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][Cheshire Viq] "why are people asking me/bringing up/criticizing me over this video that happened forever ago that i'm just asking youtube to get me more views on" 
2021-11-25 20:42:17 [textMessage] [] [Moderate Extremist] She expected it to blow up cause the live was jam packed (people love a shtshow) .... when it wasn't going viral she inquired to YT .... she could care less to be accurate, just popular/profitable

2021-11-25 19:21:49 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][An Intrigued Feline] Even though, it is STILL a lie and thereby false, it can eventually be perceived as true. Which is why there is such a thing as DEFAMATION...

2021-11-25 19:25:29 [textMessage] [] [biebel] asking for actual evidence is always such a conversation killer with steve's detractors 
2021-11-25 19:25:33 [textMessage] [] [The Dark Magician] @Rose Me too. Some people said they were screen recording because they feared something would happen to the chat.
2021-11-25 19:25:34 [textMessage] [] [Rose] @Steve EXACTLY THIS
2021-11-25 19:26:17 [textMessage] [] [Gretchen Beach] That is why I was always questioning KJ and Nat's relationship. Nat smeared KJ in the deposition, why is she on a panel with Nat?
2021-11-25 19:26:26 [textMessage] [] [Lee Veltman] Only photoshopped screenshots can be faked. 
2021-11-25 19:26:27 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][An Intrigued Feline] @Ang H More people should take the stance on objective stuff, rather than being led by their feelings or misguided by their narratives.

2021-11-25 20:00:42 [textMessage] [] [Peta Hine] I can't believe someone would draw a 3 hour "confession" from a known liar. Nat will say whatever to fit where she feels will get attention.
2021-11-25 20:01:12 [textMessage] [] [Absynthe12] KJ joined in waxy's allegations and kay did seem like she agreed
2021-11-25 20:02:05 [textMessage] [] [Claire S. Bear] @Cheshire Viq Exactly .... apparently it is harrassment to *ask people to be damn adults and accept accountability for their own actions ffs ridiculous imho *typos stink btw too
2021-11-25 20:02:07 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][Cheshire Viq] that's something I didnt understand about Irish - she wants her account of her interactions with Nat to be so important but then turns around and says it shows/proves nothing
2021-11-25 20:02:16 [textMessage] [] [Absynthe12] KJ claimed she had a "ton" of evidence against Steve
2021-11-25 20:02:22 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][Cheshire Viq] @Claire S. Bear lol
2021-11-25 20:02:27 [textMessage] [] [Peta Hine] exactly Nat got KJ's attention by suddenly blaming Steve. she went along with it cause KJ gave Nat attention after that
2021-11-25 20:02:28 [textMessage] [] [stripes] Until the FBI arrest Nat I don't trust anything from Twitter mouths.
2021-11-25 20:02:32 [textMessage] [] [Claire S. Bear] @Cheshire Viq YES! Make that make sense like wth?

2021-11-25 20:02:43 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][Ash Scott] The same shit has happened to the way people say harassment, as has happened to racism, sexism, homophobia, etc. The 2021 definitiion of harrassment is "Don't say bad shit about me twice"

2021-11-25 20:09:00 [textMessage] [] [Absynthe12] @nat if that is you. You have lost all credibility.

2021-11-25 20:09:27 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][An Intrigued Feline] If you want to see people who actually can be considered to be a cult leader, take a look at Kent Hovind. Just an example for @Steve McRae. Kent has his own compound and clique to attract there.
2021-11-25 20:09:51 [textMessage] [] [E.M.P.] wait what? this isn't a cult? damn i been tying to get initiated for at ;east 3 years . im so disappointed 
2021-11-25 20:09:52 [textMessage] [] [Claire S. Bear] @Cheshire Viq you are not alone in that, and it does look worse the more you look ... paying attention to the actions not the words ... and the historic documentation not the new narrative . 
2021-11-25 20:10:26 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][Cheshire Viq] @Nat Do you have your guardian with you? You should have your guardian reach out to steve independently 
2021-11-25 20:10:36 [textMessage] [] [Claire S. Bear] @E.M.P. I hear, disappointed, thought I was finally excepted and bang all lies lmao just lies

2021-11-25 20:13:27 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][An Intrigued Feline] @Aureii YT That means not talking to Chesh, as she is one of the people slandered against.
2021-11-25 20:13:31 [textMessage] [] [Aureii YT] I'm okay :slightly_smiling_face:

2021-11-25 20:14:11 [textMessage] [] [Rose] that "allegedly" was definitely an afterthought & was stated with a rude tone of voice
2021-11-25 20:14:23 [textMessage] [] [Unveiling The Masks] Exactly Rose 
2021-11-25 20:14:50 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][Mr. Serious] lol! i do love to use the word "allegedly" but more tongue in cheek... 
2021-11-25 20:14:53 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][Cheshire Viq] @Rose i mean then why not add that to the video? she was already editing it at this time anyway
2021-11-25 20:15:02 [textMessage] [] [Unveiling The Masks] :prohibited: hey hun! Gtsy 
2021-11-25 20:15:19 [textMessage] [] [E.M.P.] chesh murdered a bunch of bs narratives, it was bloody 
2021-11-25 20:15:28 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][Cheshire Viq] @Annie - a play on ANY in w:prohibited:acbS - or :prohibited: for short please leave that be as she does not have her guardian 
2021-11-25 20:15:51 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][An Intrigued Feline] Could've just removed the message Chesh
2021-11-25 20:16:07 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][Cheshire Viq] oh my bad

2021-11-25 20:18:02 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][Mr. Serious] menace has only accidentally been correct.... and that's extremely rare
2021-11-25 20:18:11 [textMessage] [] [Rose] that's what's so frustrating @Chesh, Kay is choosing not to correct the record. is she so afraid to grant any grace to you, Steve & the others who were accused?
2021-11-25 20:18:27 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][Cheshire Viq] @Mr. Serious and when that happens its still for the wrong reasons
2021-11-25 20:18:47 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][Mr. Serious] @Cheshire Viq yep
2021-11-25 20:19:22 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][Cheshire Viq] @Rose she is selfish - only cares when it benefits her or if things happen to her. 
2021-11-25 20:19:29 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][Mr. Serious] giving you heat is harassment 
2021-11-25 20:19:38 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][Cheshire Viq] @Steve McRae ya just ask Katie lol "its not harassment to call out the lies of a liar"
2021-11-25 20:19:38 [textMessage] [] [Suzanne is Salty "That Crazy Feminist Writer"] Asking her to correct something is not harassment
2021-11-25 20:19:41 [textMessage] [] [Claire S. Bear] @Mr. Serious a broke clock is right twice a day just saying...no credit for the lying arse 
2021-11-25 20:19:50 [textMessage] [] [E.M.P.] sad when a broken clock is right more often than m2s

2021-11-25 20:21:37 [textMessage] [] [Claire S. Bear] Why is defending yourself against misinformation being called "Harrassment" ? Are they allergic to accountability ... are they deflecting? or are they actually the harrassers? @Steve McRae 
2021-11-25 20:21:44 [textMessage] [] [Rose] :waving_hand: @Suzanne :blue_heart:

2021-11-25 20:22:59 [textMessage] [] [kimmo mäki] I heard Chesh offer a suggestion. Kay heard Chesh make a command.
2021-11-25 20:23:09 [textMessage] [] [Aureii YT] I learned this week that there's always people resisting to correct things because they don't see they put out misinformation.

2021-11-25 20:24:07 [textMessage] [] [Moderate Extremist] nothing was demanded ... an annotation to her "update" with 1/4 of the views was politely suggested, she just isn't an honest agent, again, she can take several seats 
2021-11-25 20:24:10 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][Mr. Serious] Yeah... call me out! :drooling_face:

2021-11-25 20:25:38 [textMessage] [] [Rhianna Johnson] Cheshire specifically said it was advice and even followed it up with "you don't have to take my advice". I'm shocked at the outright lies, especially when it's on video

2021-11-25 20:33:45 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][Cheshire Viq] and "maybe" and "could"
2021-11-25 20:33:48 [textMessage] [] [Aureii YT] Was Kay who said Steve asked her to remove the video?
2021-11-25 20:33:59 [textMessage] [] [Miss E] Kay should just admit she thought it was you behind it and now she she doesn’t. At least say my bad but don’t deny you thought and said it.
2021-11-25 20:34:02 [textMessage] [] [kimmo mäki] I've asked several sincere questions and Steve's responses have always been honest, forthright and relevant.

2021-11-25 20:36:49 [textMessage] [] [Miss E] It seemed like she was implying that the trolls were sent by you in the Live. That’s what I thought she meant
2021-11-25 20:37:01 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][Cheshire Viq] Plus when it was edited if it WAS in the algorithm, it would have been pulled OUT

2021-11-25 20:38:24 [superChat] [NZ$5.00] [AureaUnicornis] She wants to know why the video on which you and several people were falsely accused is not getting more views. That video without any clarification. 
2021-11-25 20:39:23 [textMessage] [] [Shieena Living Waters] I listened to videos in question so i could weigh in. Seems a lot of vagueness and ambiguity from those 2 women. Seems they are uncomfortable admitting any wrongs.

2021-11-25 21:42:25 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][Cheshire Viq] and her video was streamed on July 17th, so thats 1 month and a total of 17 tweets over the course of that.
2021-11-25 21:43:06 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][An Intrigued Feline] @Cheshire Viq Correct. Just counted them myself to say the same.

2021-11-25 21:43:53 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][Cheshire Viq] 17 tweets from him to her. 9 from her to him. with I think 3 that are "deleted" that APPEAR to be her as there is no one else getting tagged 
2021-11-25 21:43:53 [textMessage] [] [Moderator][An Intrigued Feline] 8 Tweets on August 13th, 9 on the other day.
