2021-12-04 00:40:45 [textMessage] [] [Rose the Flying Monkey] @Tina I think she inwardly groans every time she sees me in her chat. At first some of her mods were d!cks to me but now they're kind & actually welcoming.

2021-12-04 00:42:22 [textMessage] [] [Heather Mcdonald] @essohayee I am not sure about that and would not be surprised if they are not. Waxy is in hiding but even when Charlotte threw her under the bus she still was a mod for her and was in C's lives

2021-12-04 00:46:37 [textMessage] [] [Rez Instance] The fact that YT is aware of KJ on any level and HAVEN'T deleted her channel forever....
2021-12-04 00:46:37 [textMessage] [] [Tina Illcutyou] You can’t just go around accusing other creators of crimes let alone people that you cover

2021-12-04 00:49:30 [textMessage] [] [Rose the Flying Monkey] exactly @Tina, these people are so loose with their language that they casually throw around accusations of serious crimes. Because of Tim, my language tends to be concrete, else he can't succeed.
